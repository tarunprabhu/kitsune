/// A mobile pointer.
///
/// Mobile pointers are simply pointers to buffers whose contents may be moved
/// between devices. The data could be copied explicitly to and from host
/// memory and device (usually GPU) memory, or it could be done automatically,
/// for instance by allocating the data using UVM.
///
/// This is simply a wrapper around a raw pointer and does not enforce
/// additional semantics like an std::unique_ptr or an std::shared_ptr might.
/// This is intentional because this type is intended to allow for a somewhat
/// less invasive port from vanilla C++ to something that Kitsune can exploit.
/// However, this cannot be used interchangeably with raw pointers, or any
/// of the C++ smart pointers. The intention is to require the programmer to
/// explicitly annotate buffers that are mobile. In order to maintain
/// semantic similarity with raw pointers, the destructor will not free the
/// allocated pointer (if any). That must be done explicitly, otherwise, as
/// with regular pointers, memory may be leaked.
///
/// If the mobile type attribute is eventually added, users should prefer to
/// use that, but there is no guarantee that that attribute will be portable.
/// This, on the other hand, is guaranteed to be portable across C++ compilers.
