 *      (currently 256).  This is a global setting and will apply to
 *      all kernel launches.
 *
 *    - **KITCUDA_DEVICE_ID**: Select a specific GPU device to use.
 *      This is intended to allow experimentation across different
 *      GPUs within a single system.  The runtime currently only
 *      supports a single GPU and this will default to the first GPU
 *      in the system if left unset.
