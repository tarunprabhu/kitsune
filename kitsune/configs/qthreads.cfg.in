# Compiler and/or linker options can be added here to add to (or override) those
# added automatically by Kitsune for the 'qthreads' target. 
#
# Other options can be added here as well, but any options not exclusively
# intended for the 'qthreads' target should be added to ${KITSUNE_C_FRONTEND}.cfg or ${KITSUNE_CXX_FRONTEND}.cfg.
