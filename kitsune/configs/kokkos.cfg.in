# Compiler/linker options for Kokkos mode (-fkokkos). The options added by
# default are below:
#
# The driver will add the kokkos libraries to the argument list automatically
# but you may need to tweak the search paths depending upon your use case.
# 
# Other options can be added here as well, but any options not exclusively
# intended for Kokkos mode should be added to ${KITSUNE_C_FRONTEND}.cfg or ${KITSUNE_CXX_FRONTEND}.cfg.
